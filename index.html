            It's not mere extremism that makes folks at the fringes so troubling; it's extremism wedded to false beliefs. 
            Humans have long been dupes, easily gulled by rumors and flat-out lies.Alzheimer’s creates a kind of friction 
            that the family needs to be strong for. You have to hold onto things and know what is true in life.</p>

             Over time, a person with dementia will become more dependent. To reduce frustration, stay flexible and adapt 
             your routine and expectations as needed.Each person with Alzheimer's disease will experience its symptoms and 
             progression differently. Tailor these practical tips to your family member's needs. Patience and flexibility —
            along with self-care and the support of friends and family — can help you deal with the challenges and frustrations ahead.

For example, if he or she wants to wear the same outfit every day, consider buying a few identical outfits. If bathing is met with resistance, consider doing it less often.

            but good nutrition can ease some symptoms and help them feel good.When you’re caring for someone 
            with the condition, there are simple ways you can make eating healthier, easier, and more enjoyable.Ask your 
            loved one’s health care team if there are any foods or drinks that can keep the medicines they take from working.
            Also check if any of the meds affect their appetite, bowel movements, or cause other problems that can affect 
            their nutrition. Their doctor may be able to change the dose or suggest another drug that will ease side effects.
            Someone with Alzheimer’s may not drink enough water because their body's signal for thirst isn’t as strong as it was.
             Some medicines can dry out their mouth, too. Remind your loved one to drink water, and try other ways to avoid dry mouth:</p>
